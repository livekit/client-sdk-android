# LiveKit Android SDK

## Commands

Supported platforms: Android (minimum API level 21)

- Assemble: `./gradlew assemble`
- Run tests: `./gradlew test`
- Install example app: `./gradlew sample-app-compose:installDebug`

## Architecture

The SDK is provided through the `livekit-android-sdk` Gradle module (package root `io.livekit.android`).

```

Entry types such as `LiveKit` and `ConnectOptions` live in the `io.livekit.android` package alongside these directories.

Key components:

- `LiveKit` - main entry point; creates a `Room` object.
- `Room` - primary class that users will interact with; manages connection state, participants, and
  tracks
- `Participant` - base class for `LocalParticipant`/`RemoteParticipant`; holds track publications
- `SignalClient` - WebSocket connection to LiveKit server
- `FlowDelegate` - provides the consumption of class members marked with `@FlowObservable` as a
  `Flow` through the `flow` property extension.

## WebRTC

WebRTC handles the actual media transport (audio/video/data) between participants. The SDK abstracts
WebRTC complexity behind `Room`, `Participant`, and `Track` APIs while LiveKit server coordinates
signaling.

Key classes:

- `PeerConnectionTransport` - wraps a `PeerConnection`; handles ICE candidates, SDP offer/answer
- `RTCEngine` - integrates the SignalClient and PeerConnectionTransport into a consolidated
  connection
- `io.livekit.android.webrtc` package - convenience extensions on WebRTC types

Threading:

- All WebRTC API calls must use `executeOnRTCThread`, `executeBlockingOnRTCThread`, or
  `launchBlockingOnRTCThread` for thread safety
- Each call requires a `RTCThreadToken` that manages the thread execution requests

## Dependency Injection

This library makes extensive use of Dagger to provide dependency injection throughout the codebase.

- Dependency needs should be met through injecting into an `@Inject` or `@AssistedInject` annotated
  constructor
- Variable dependencies (such as IDs, varying implementations) can be provided through the use of an
  `@AssistedFactory`

## FlowObservable

The SDK heavily relies on `@FlowObservable` class members, which allow them to be used as regular
variables,
while also allowing them to be observed as a `Flow`. This is especially useful for Android Compose
projects,
as this allows them to be converted to `State` objects and update the UI appropriately.

```kotlin
val identity = participant.identity // regular access
val identityFlow = participant::identity.flow // as a flow
val identityState = participant::identity.flow.collectAsState() // as a state
```

A `@FlowObservable` class member can be created using the `flowDelegate` property delegate:

```kotlin
@FlowObservable
@get:FlowObservable
var identity: Identity? by flowDelegate(identity)
```

## Testing

Unit tests are provided through the `livekit-android-test` module.

- `io.livekit.android.test.mock` package - mocks and fakes
- `MockE2ETest` - the base class for when testing `Room` behavior

## Using Kotlin

### Concurrency and State

- The SDK uses coroutines for background thread processing.
- Classes should create and own their own coroutine scope if they use coroutines.

### Error Handling

- Crashing consumer code via unchecked exceptions is **not allowed**
- `assert()`/`Preconditions` should be avoided
- Prefer returning `Result` rather than throwing exceptions.
- Methods that can throw exceptions must be annotated with `@throws` in the documentation.
- For recoverable errors, consider defensive programming first (retry, backoff, graceful failure)
- Anticipate invalid states at compile time using algebraic data types, typestates, etc.

### Coding Style

- Follow official Kotlin code style
- Consistency across features is more important than latest syntactic sugar
- Run `./gradlew spotless` to check for code style; **do not** introduce new warnings
- Deprecation warnings are allowed in public APIs; do not fix them
- `// Code comments` should be used sparingly; prefer better naming/structuring
- Do not add trivial "what" comments like `// Here is the change`
- Kdoc comments for **every** public API
- Add short code examples for new APIs to the entry point (e.g., `Room` class)
- Use `LKLog` for logging
